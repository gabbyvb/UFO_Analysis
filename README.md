 **Overview of Project** 
Top provide people with an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings throughout the United States.

With multiple search criteria, a user can find a specific UFO event even if they don't know all the details. For instance, if they wanted to see spherical UFO sighting in  California, they'd have the ability to do that.

**Summary**  
With this new design, users would still need to know the exact date a sighting occurred. If she wanted to make the site more user friendly, she could separate out the date filter so people can filter by Month or Year to help narrow down their selections. Another way to further develop the site would be adding in links to any news articles or images so people can continue to do research on the specific sighting that they found.
